You are building a simple voice-controlled desktop assistant for Windows.

The assistant will:
- Continuously listen to the microphone.
- Recognize specific spoken commands like:
  - "computer speaker on"
  - "computer give me a therapy"
- Respond to commands by:
  - Playing sound files (e.g., MP3s) via the default speaker (eventually Bluetooth).
  - Looking up and selecting files using a local CSV (e.g., therapy sounds listed by category).
- Be simple enough for a beginner programmer to understand and modify.

Project requirements:
- Language: Python 3
- Tools/libraries:
  - `speech_recognition` for voice input.
  - `playsound` for audio playback.
  - `csv` for reading local lookup tables.
  - (Optional) `pyttsx3` for text-to-speech responses later.
- The code should be clear and beginner-friendly, with comments explaining key steps.
- The app should run in a loop: listen, understand, respond.

Folder structure:
- `main.py` — the main program loop.
- `therapies.csv` — a file listing therapy sounds by type.
- `sounds/` — folder to store sound files.

Example therapy CSV format:
type,filename  
calm,sounds/calm1.mp3  
funny,sounds/funny1.mp3

Stretch goals (optional):
- Let the user say "computer play [filename]" and play that file if it exists.
- Switch output to Bluetooth speakers using OS settings (platform-dependent).
- Add voice feedback using `pyttsx3`.

The system does not need a graphical interface, just terminal output for now.
Start with a working prototype that listens for two commands and plays one file.
